As of December 2023:

This repository currently contains **"work in progress"** code. 

While the code compiles, it is non-functional and will **NOT** operate as expected.  Indeed it has not even been run on HW in any form (yet).

The repository is public purely to make it easy for MERG members to review changes made to the existing Arduino library code.
