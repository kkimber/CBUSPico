/// @brief A class to manage setting and storage of CBUS module parameters
///
/// @details Each CBUS Module maintains a number of parameters that are used primarily by CBUS configuration tools
///          to obtain information on the firmware running in the module.  The parameters define things like software
///          versions, capabilies of the module, i.e. if it is a Producer, Consumer or "Combi" module.  There are nominally
///          twenty defined parameters, although CBUS allows more to be defined in future.  During initial configuration of a
///          module, the first seven parameters can be read via Request Node Parameters (RQNP).  After initial configuration
///          any node parameter can be read via Request read of a node parameter by index (RQNPN).  Node parameters are 
///          numbered from one to twenty, however performing a RQNPN for parameter zero will return the number of available
///          parameters in the module.  Indexes for the parameters are in cbusdefs.h as PAR_xxx, e.g. PAR_MTYP.
///          The CBUS definition header, cbusdefs.h, includes defines values for a number of the parameters, e.g. manufacturer
///          codes, module ID's etc. Module developers should ensure they do not conflict or reuse ID's already defined by CBUS.
